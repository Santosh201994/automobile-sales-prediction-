### automobile-sales-prediction in recession vs non recession time

This projects involves data analysis of an automobile sales company to get insight from the data

Downloaded an already cleaned dataset which was artificially created for the purpose of the project.
Developed a Line chart using the functionality of pandas to show how automobile sales fluctuate from year to year.
Plot different lines for categories of vehicle type and analyse the trend to find out if there is a noticeable difference in sales trends between different vehicle types during recession periods.
Used the functionality of Seaborn Library and pandas to create a visualizations to compare the sales trend in various periods to gain insights to data



### CONCLUTION

During analysis it is noticeable that sales were significantly low during recession period.
• The GDP is a factor that affected sales during the recession periods therefore working on 
raising the GDP will like raise the sales of the vehicles 
• There iss little to no relationship between the vehicle prices and sales hence it should not 
be an area of focus 
• Increasing unemployment rate affects the sales of the low range vehicles like
superminicar,smallfamilycar and Mediumminicar hence more effort should be placed on 
the sales of such vehicles during those times.
